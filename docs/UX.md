# UX & Design System

## Tokens
- Dark theme; primary blue, energy orange; Inter typography as in design tokens
- Card style: 16pt radius, systemGray6 backgrounds, consistent paddings

## Patterns
- 30-sec Quick Log: minimal required fields, big touch targets, haptics + success hint
- Skeletons on data fetch; empty states with actionable CTAs
- Optimistic UI on reactions; lightweight error banners on network failures
- Notification toggles in Settings (daily check-in, follow-ups)
- Onboarding: privacy-first (anonymous by default), notification CTA

## Accessibility
- 44pt minimum targets; VoiceOver labels/values on list items; avoid reliance on color only; Dynamic Type friendly layouts

## Microcopy
- Empathetic, Gen Z voice; short, encouraging phrases (e.g., “Logged. That’s strength.”)
- Avoid clinical/corporate tone; be direct and supportive
